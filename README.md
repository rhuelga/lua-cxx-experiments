# lua-cxx-experiments

Experimenting with lua and C++ binding

The purpose of this files, is to test ways to make lua and c++ work together for other projects I have.

The app requires [bandit](https://github.com/joakimkarlsson/bandit) and [gmock](https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/) to compile

The code it's a bit nasty (here I make quick tests), but if you found it helpful, please drop me a line.
